          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            <br> <b>Career as a scientist</b>
            <br>This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.

            A P J Abdul Kalam[25]
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]

             In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
